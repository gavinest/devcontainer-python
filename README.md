# devcontainer python

This repo is sets up a devcontainer with the following niceties:

1. Zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)
2. [Dotfiles](@/posts/easy-dotfiles-with-chezmoi.md)
3. Vim
4. Python and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and dependencies

It pairs with my [blog post](https://estenssorog.com/posts/devcontainers-that-feel-like-home/) on the topic.
