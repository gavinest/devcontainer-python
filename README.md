# dev-container

Make [VSCode devcontainers](link to vscode dev containers) feel like home.

This repo sets up a VSCode devcontainer with the following:

* familiar shell setting via [dotfiles](link to blog)
* [zsh](link to zsh) and [oh-my-zsh](link to oh-my-zsh)

It pairs with my blog [post](link to future post) on the topic.
